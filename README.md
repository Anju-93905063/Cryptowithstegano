**Author**: G. Himanjali

## Overview
This project integrates **cryptography** and **steganography** to provide a secure way of hiding and encrypting messages. By combining both techniques, the system ensures that the hidden message is not only unreadable but also invisible to prying eyes. This project aims to demonstrate how these two methods work together to enhance digital security.

## Features
- **Cryptography**: Encrypts messages so they can only be read by authorized individuals.
- **Steganography**: Hides encrypted messages within other data, like images or text, to conceal the existence of the message.
- **Simple Interface**: The project includes easy-to-use functions for both encryption and decryption, and for embedding and extracting hidden messages.
